Website about me created by myself

Hello! My name is Jevgenijs Majevskis and this website is about me. If you are my potential employer than you will be interested in this project. You will learn everything about who I am and what are my goals.

Obviously you will be abele to get all this information from the CV and CL that I sent to you, but this website will also show you my programming skills.

The website can also be considered as a website made by some freelancer. Right now there is a tab known as 'Curriculum Vitae', but it can always be renamed to 'Portfolio' and redesigned.

N.B. This website is in English whereas my CV and CL are both in German.
