        <p>
          As you already know my name is Jevgenijs Majevskis and I am just a guy from a small city Ventspils located in 
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvia" target="_blank">Latvia</a>, where I spent my whole life. Of course after I have finished the 
          secondary school I moved to the capital city Riga, where I went to Latvian University and studied German Philology. Right now you most likely 
          wandering, how come that german philologist is working as Web Developer/UI Designer. Well... It is a long story and I do not want you to start 
          yawning, so let me tell you the short one.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have chosen this studying program because I did not know exactly what I wanted to do and what I wanted to be. After I have successfully 
          obtained a bachelor degree and since I can speak 4 different languages Russian, Latvian, English and German, I decided to become a translator, 
          but it did nit work... I simply did not enjoy being a translator, so after a year of master's degree I quit. This was a moment when I started to
          think that I am doing something wrong in my life. I spent about 7 or 8 month trying to work as airline tickets seller, then I used to work in 
          online casino for 2 years. That is a lot. Do not get me wrong, I have met a lot of good people and I have mastered my English even more, plus I 
          have learned new stuff.
        </p>
        <p>
          However it was not enough for me to feel myself on the right place, so I started a new chapter. In July 2022 I decided to learn how to code and 
          to become a programmer. So I spent months, days, hours just learning new information. I started with some online courses from 
          <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/" target="_blank">The Odin Project</a> where I have learned the basics of programming and obviously
          programming languages, such as: HTML, SCC, JavaScript. The last one is kind of complicated, it means I am still learning it, but I already know 
          a lot (I think :D). This course also led me through Git and GitHub, Node.js and a lot of great websites to practice and search for new
          information. Of corse <a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank">YouTube</a> played a huge role in my development as well, since 
          there are a lot of great teachers, who can explain about <strong>anything!</strong>, for example Python, which I also started to learn. 
          THE POWER OF THE INTERNET!
        </p>
        <p>
          So yes, you have understood everything correct. I am a self-taught <span>Web Developer</span> and <span>UI Designer</span>. And I am 
          extremely proud of myself!
