          <p>
            Exactly! The truth is, that nowadays anyone can learn almost everything by using Google and YouTube. The best part of programming is, that 
            there are thousands of tutorials out there in the internet. If you have enough patience, willing and interest, you can become a pro 
            programmer by yourself.

        <h2 class="faq-question">Why did you decide to become a programmer?</h2>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            First of all, because of the good work and life balance. Second, this is something absolutely new for me and I wanted to know, if I can 
            actually accomplish the challenge. And third, I was always interested in how computers, websites and webpages, app work. And now I finally 
            know :)

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            No, not yet! I still have a lot to learn and of course, I need to practice. But already now I know how to use Git and GitHub, what kind of 
            platforms to use, like <a href="https://replit.com/">Replit.com</a>, I can use HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript ot create good looking 
            websites and I am ready to improve my skills and knowledge.
